** Open ZFS On Windows **

** THIS IS AN EARLY ALPHA OF OPEN ZFS **

It is recommended that this software is only used on test VMs, with test POOLS
and test DATA. The Developer(s) can not be held responsible if you lose your
Windows, and/or data using this software. This is the wild west people, 
the edge of the frontier.

Having said that, if you find yourself in a boot loop - when Windows 10 fails to
boot two times in a row, you can enter the Advanced Console, and delete the 
ZFSin.SYS file from C:\Windows\Drivers to boot normally.
